\begin{abstract}
We exploit the equivalence between $t$-structures and normal torsion theories on a stable $\infty$-category to show how a few classical topics in the theory of triangulated categories, i.e., the characterization of bounded $t$-structures in terms of their hearts, their associated cohomology functors, semiorthogonal decompositions, and the theory of tiltings, as well as the more recent notion of Bridgeland's slicings, are all particular instances of a single construction, namely, the tower of a morphism associated with a $J$-slicing of a stable $\infty$-category $\C$, where $J$ is a totally ordered set equipped with a monotone $\mathbb{Z}$-action.

%  \begin{itemize}
%   \item[] By far the biggest flaw in the exposition is the omission of the definition of a “pullout” square.
%   \item[] Again, as a matter of the reader’s convenience, it would probably be
%   good to isolate the statement of the Sator lemma in a reference-able
%   proposition type format.
%   \item[] the authors are not very clear on which aspects of
%   the theory actually depend on the stable infty-category itself as opposed
%   to only its triangulated homotopy category. 
%   \item Definition 5.18 appears to be completely unnecessary to me;
%   \item I do not understand the latter half of the proof of lemma 7.8, beginning
%   with “let X be an object of C and consider...”
%   \item The statement and “proof” of theorem 8.2 is clumsy.
%   \item[] In fact I think the authors do themselves a slight disservice by promoting their paper as part of the theory of stable infty-categories, when really
%   much of what they do is only at the level of triangulated categories,
%   and thus might attact a wider readership (there is basically nowhere in
%   the paper where actual higher categorical arguments are employed).
